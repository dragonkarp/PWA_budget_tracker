## PWA Budget Tracker App

## Michael Li Fullstack Boot Camp

## Development Process
# The front end code was given. I added a manifest file and use indexdb to store data locally. The app is downloadable for offline functionality. Indexdb will store use requests locally and connect to the server with with updates and requests when online again. The core files added to make this a truly offline app are the manifest.webmanifest and service-worker.js files.
